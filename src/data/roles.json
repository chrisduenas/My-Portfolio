We move quick and perform under pressure at high volume when needed. As a Mixologist , designing high quality cocktails with a superior knowledge of spirits is just as important. Mixology involves  preparation of house-made syrups, bitters, liquor infusions and other ingredients for quality cocktails that fit the style of the establishment. "

            "description": "I enjoy staying healthy and hitting the gym with a plan at least four days a week. I focus mainly on weightlifting for building mass and calisthenics for staying toned and athletic. I recently started doing yoga and running more often. Switching my routines is always something that has always challenged me and avoided plateaus. Of course, there have been days where I skipped exercise but one ritual that I always stick to is maintaining a balanced diet.  I prepare my meals for the week and portion them accordingly. Meal prepping is important to me I have continued doing so the past four years."
